Of  par-\\nticular  recent  interest  are  the  large \\nlearned  systems  based  on  trans-\\nformer  architectures  that  are  trained \\nwith  billions  of  parameters  over \\nmassive  Web-scale  multimodal  cor-\\npora.  Prominent  examples  include \\nlarge  language  models  (https://bit.\\nly/3iGdekA) like GPT3 and PALM that \\nrespond  to  free-form  text  prompts, \\nand \\nlike \\nlanguage/image  models \\nDALL-E  and  Imagen  that  can  map \\ntext prompts to photorealistic images \\n(and even those with claims to gener-\\nal behaviors, such as GATO) .\\n\\nThe  emergence  of  these \\n\\nlarge \\nlearned  models  is  also  changing  the \\nnature  of  AI  research  in  fundamen-\\n\\ntal  ways.  Just  the  other  day,  some  re-\\nsearchers  were  playing  with  DALL-E \\nand thought that it seems to have de-\\nveloped  a  secret  language  of  its  own \\n(https://bit.ly/3ahH1Py)  which,  if  we \\ncan  master,  might  allow  us  to  inter-\\nact  with  it  better.  Other  researchers \\nfound  that  GPT3’s  responses  to  rea-\\nsoning questions can be improved by \\nadding certain seemingly magical in-\\ncantations to the prompt (https://bit.\\nly/3aelxmI),  the  most  prominent  of \\nthese being “Let’s think step by step.” \\nIt  is  almost  as  if  the  large  learned \\nmodels  like  GPT3  and  DALL-E  are \\nalien  organisms  whose  behavior  we \\nare trying to decipher.\\n\\nThis  is  certainly  a  strange  turn  of \\nevents  for  AI.  Since  its  inception,  AI \\nhas  existed  in  the  no-man’s  land  be-\\ntween  engineering  (which  aims  at \\ndesigning  systems  for  specific  func-\\ntions),  and  “Science”  (which  aims  to \\ndiscover  the  regularities  in  naturally \\noccurring  phenomena).  The  science \\npart  of  AI  came  from  its  original  pre-\\ntensions  to  provide  insights  into  the \\nnature of (human) intelligence, while \\nthe  engineering  part  came  from  a  fo-\\ncus  on  intelligent  function  (get  com-\\nputers  to  demonstrate  intelligent  be-\\n\\nhavior)  rather  than  on  insights  about \\nnatural intelligence.\\n\\nThis  situation  is  changing  rapid-\\nly–especially  as  AI  is  becoming  syn-\\nonymous  with  large  learned  models. \\nSome  of  these  systems  are  coming  to \\na point where we not only do not know \\nhow the models we trained are able to \\nshow specific capabilities, we are very \\nmuch in the dark even about what ca-\\npabilities they might have (PALM’s al-\\nleged capability of  “explaining jokes” \\n—https://bit.ly/3yJk1m4— is a case in \\npoint).  Often,  even  their  creators  are \\ncaught  off  guard  by  things  these  sys-\\ntems  seem  capable  of  doing.  Indeed, \\nprobing  these  systems  to  get  a  sense \\nof the scope of their “emergent behav-\\niors”  has  become  quite  a  trend  in  AI \\nresearch of late.\\n\\nGiven  this  state  of  affairs,  it  is  in-\\ncreasingly clear that at least part of AI is \\nstraying firmly away from its “engineer-\\ning”  roots.  It  is  increasingly  hard  to \\nconsider large learned systems as “de-\\nsigned” in the traditional sense of the \\nword, with a specific purpose in mind. \\nAfter all, we don’t go around saying we \\nare “designing” our kids (seminal work \\nand  gestation  notwithstanding).  Be-\\nsides,  engineering  disciplines  do  not \\n\\n8    COM M UNICATIO NS  O F  TH E ACM  |  SEPTEMBER 2022  |  VOL. 65  |  NO. 9\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter at http://twitter.com/blogCACMThe Communications website, https://cacm.acm.org,  features more than a dozen bloggers in the BLOG@CACM  community.

The knowledge we glean \\nfrom  such  studies  might  allow  us  to \\nintervene  in  modulating  the  system’s \\nbehavior  a  little  (as  medicine  does). \\nThe in vitro part does, of course, allow \\nfor  far  more  targeted  interventions \\nthan in vivo settings do.\\n\\nAI’s  turn  to  natural  science  also \\nhas implications to computer science \\nat  large–given  the  outsized  impact  AI \\nseems  to  be  having  on  almost  all  ar-\\neas of computing. The “science” suffix \\nof  computer  science  has  sometimes \\nbeen  questioned  and  caricatured \\n(https://bit.ly/3Ayp2PT);  perhaps  not \\nany  longer,  as  AI  becomes  an  ersatz \\nnatural science studying large learned \\nartifacts.  Of  course,  there  might  be \\nsignificant methodological resistance \\nand reservations to this shift. After all, \\nCS has long been used to the “correct \\nby  construction”  holy  grail,  and  from \\nthere it is quite a shift to getting used \\nto living with systems that are at best \\nincentivized (“dog trained”) to be sort \\nof  correct—sort  of  like  us  humans! \\nIndeed, in a 2003 lecture, Turing lau-\\nreate Leslie Lamport sounded alarms \\nabout the very possibility of the future \\nof  computing  belonging  to  biology \\nrather than logic, saying it will lead us \\n\\nto living in a world of homeopathy and \\nfaith  healing  (https://bit.ly/3ahrsaI)! \\nTo  think  that  his  angst  was  mostly  at \\ncomplex  software  systems  that  were \\nstill  human-coded,  rather  than  about \\nthese  even  more  mysterious  large \\nlearned models!\\n\\nAs  we  go  from  being  a  field  fo-\\ncused  primarily  on \\nintentionally \\ndesigned  artifacts  and  “correct  by \\ntowards \\nconstruction  guarantees” \\none  trying  to  explore/understand \\nsome  existing  (undesigned)  artifact, \\nit  is  perhaps  worth  thinking  aloud \\nit  will \\nthe  methodological  shifts \\nbring.  After  all,  unlike  biology  that \\n(mostly) studies organisms that exist \\nin  the  wild,  AI  will  be  studying  arti-\\nfacts  that  we  created  (although  not \\n“designed”),  and  there  will  certainly \\nbe  ethical  questions  about  what  ill-\\nunderstood organisms we should be \\nwilling to create and deploy. For one, \\nlarge  learned  models  are  unlikely  to \\nsupport  provable  capability-relevant \\nguarantees—be  it  regarding  accura-\\ncy, transparency, or fairness (https://\\nbit.ly/3IhdL8i).  This  brings  up  criti-\\ncal questions about best practices of \\ndeploying  these  systems.  While  hu-\\nmans  also  cannot  provide  iron-clad \\nproofs about the correctness of their \\ndecisions  and  behavior,  we  do  have \\nlegal systems in place for keeping us \\nin line with penalties–fines, censure, \\nor even jail time. What would be the \\nequivalent for large learned systems?\\nThe  aesthetics  of  computing  re-\\nsearch will no doubt change, too. A dear \\ncolleague of mine used to preen that he \\nrates  papers—including  his  own—by \\nthe ratio of theorems to definitions. As \\nour objectives become more like those \\nof  natural  sciences  such  as  biology, \\nwe  will  certainly  need  to  develop  new \\nmethodological aesthetics (as zero the-\\norems  by  zero  definitions  ratio  won’t \\nbe  all  that  discriminative!).  There  are \\nalready \\nthat  computa-\\ntional  complexity  analyses  have  taken \\na  back  seat  in  AI  research  (https://bit.\\nly/3P5sJQZ)!\\n\\nindications \\n\\nSubbarao Kambhampati is a professor at the School of \\nComputing & AI at Arizona State University, and a former \\npresident of the Association for the Advancement of \\nArtificial Intelligence.
